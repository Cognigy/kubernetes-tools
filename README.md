# Cognigy.AI k8s tools
This repository contains the source code of tools we provide in order to get started with Cognigy.AI on top of Kubernetes (k8s).

For details on how to use these tools, have a look at our **kubernetes** repository which stores the manifest files necessary for a k8s deployment as well as all information necessary to get starated.

You can find our Kubernetes repository [here](https://github.com/Cognigy/kubernetes)
